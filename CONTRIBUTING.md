# Contribution Guidelines for Looksyk

Thank you for your interest in this project! It's a private open-source hobby project that I maintain in my free time. Therefore, there are some simple but important rules for contributions:

## üéØ Project Goal
This project is primarily intended to remain functional, stable, and easy to understand. It is available for free, but maintenance is provided without commercial support and for a limited time.

## ‚úÖ Contributions are welcome!
Feel free to contribute, e.g. E.g., with:
- Functional enhancements
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Suggestions that provide clear added value

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What I don't want
Please refrain from:
- Discussions about purely stylistic issues (e.g., branch names, commit formats) if they don't solve functional problems
- Criticism without concrete solutions or practical benefits
- PRs or issues that restructure existing functionality without a clear benefit

## üí° Submitting suggestions
If you have ideas or requests:
1. Please describe specifically what you are suggesting.
2. Why is it helpful?
3. If possible, offer a solution or PR right away.


## üå≥ Writing PRs
I value well-structured code. All code styles and best practices are automatically reviewed by various GitHub Actions.

Please ensure that your changes do not violate the guidelines beforehand. To do so, run the file `bash run-ci-manual.sh` and check that the text "all done" is displayed and that no changes have been made automatically in the Git repository.



I reserve the right to close issues or pull requests that don't fit the project framework or that require too much maintenance without providing any benefit.

Thank you for your understanding and enjoy the project!
