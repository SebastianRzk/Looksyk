title: Looksyk - Migration from Logseq
---

# Migrate your existing Logseq graph to Looksyk

1. Start the application to create an empty graph
2. Copy your journals into the journal folder (`~/graph/journals`)
3. Copy your pages into the pages folder (`~/graph/pages`)
4. Copy your assets into the assets folder (`~/graph/assets`)
5. Start / Restart the backend
6. (Optional): Replace all labels `#myTag` with `[[myTag]]` in your pages so the tags are recognized by the backend.
7. (Optional): Replace your queries with the Looksyk query syntax
8. (Optional): Replace your todos with the markdown checkbox / todo syntax. '[x]' for done, '[ ]' for todo.
